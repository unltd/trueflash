A simple flashlight app for Android

I wrote this because a wanted a simple app to use the camera LED on my phone as a flashlight, without a lot of bells 
and whistles, and without needing Internet access, display ads, etc.

So there it is.  Just like a real flashlight, the entire UI consists of a single button.  Pressing it will turn the 
light on and off.

It doesn't have any other features, or attempt to work with obscure devices or old android versions.  So far it's only
been tested on a Samsung Droid Charge running Android 2.3.6, but it should work on most common 
devices.
